# MALib
MALib is a centralized public library management system destinated to local Moroccan libraries willing to offer online services for their users and ease the work for employees


Todo list :
- Main admin panel to add/delete libraries and classify them by disctrict/region, then print a personnalized instructions booklet for them
- Library area : add/delete books and add members to the centralized database (each library can later just add the member by ID card number), manage books check-in/out
- Set up the public pages where users can seach articles without registering, then reserve books they added to their basket if they are registered in the library
